# Drop this folder in a directory and run it. It will organize all of your files into folder by first letter
# This was inspired by my mom (maybe you can relate?)
# This took much longer than I thought it would to figure this out, but I learned which modules are good for file handling.
# It took about an hour to come up with the base of the program, which organizes files by first letter or number
# I would like it to eventually recursively go into folders getting files and organizing them into folders.
# This was made using a straight ahead approach.
# For beginners, a directory is a folder.
